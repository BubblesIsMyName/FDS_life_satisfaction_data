# Life Satisfaction and Political Views in Eastern Bloc Versus Western Europe

Project Background: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was formed following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 to invest in projects that promote open market economies in these former communist countries. The EBRD has carried out three **Life in Transition Surveys (LiTS)** in 2006, 2010, and 2016 to gauge progress and barriers to this goal by asking people in these countries about various aspects of their lives, values, and perceptions.

Our project aims to replicate part of their results and extend them in relation to life satisfaction and political views.

The Project is split across several notebooks. Please open and run all cells of the notebooks in this order:
