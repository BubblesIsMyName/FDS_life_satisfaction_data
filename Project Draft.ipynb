The article stated that 'just over half the respondents from former Soviet states...thought a return to a more authoritarian system would be a plus in some circumstances'. In figure 2, however, we can see that no country had more than 50% of its respondents answer this way. We suspect that The Guardian claimed this based on an inversion of the EBRD chief economist's statement that 'in most of our countries the majority doesn't seem to prefer democracy over authoritarian rule'. However, the newspaper must not have taken into account that there were two other response options, namely, 'don't know' and 'it does not matter whether a government is democratic or authoritarian'.
